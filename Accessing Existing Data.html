    <p>The system must achieve a critical usefulness early on. Existing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">hypertext</a>
    systems have had to justify themselves solely on new data. If, however, there
    was an existing base of data of personnel, for example, to which new data
    could be linked, the value of each new piece of data would be greater.</p>
    
    <p>What is required is a gateway program which will map an existing structure
    onto the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">hypertext</a> model, and allow limited (perhaps read-only) access to it.
    This takes the form of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">hypertext</a> server written to provide existing
    information in a form matching the standard interface. One would not imagine
    the server actually generating a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">hypertext</a> database from and existing one:
    rather, it would generate a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">hypertext</a> view of an existing database.</p>

    <p>Some examples of systems which could be connected in this way are</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>uucp News</dt>
        <dd>This is a Unix electronic conferencing system. A server for uucp news
          could makes links between notes on the same subject, as well as showing
          the structure of the conferences.</dd>
          <br>
      <dt>VAX/Notes</dt>
        <dd>This is Digital's electronic conferencing system. It has a fairly wide
          following in FermiLab, but much less in CERN. The topology of a
          conference is quite restricting.</dd>
          <br>
      <dt>CERNDOC</dt>
        <dd>This is a document registration and distribution system running on
          CERN's VM machine. As well as documents, categories and projects,
          keywords and authors lend themselves to representation as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">hypertext</a>
          nodes.</dd>
          <br>
      <dt>File systems</dt>
        <dd>This would allow any file to be linked to from other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">hypertext</a>
          documents.</dd>
          <br>
      <dt>The Telephone Book</dt>
        <dd>Even this could even be viewed as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">hypertext</a>, with links between people
          and sections, sections and groups, people and floors of buildings,
        etc.</dd>
        <br>
      <dt>The unix manual</dt>
        <dd>This is a large body of computer-readable text, currently organised in
          a flat way, but which also contains link information in a standard
          format ("See also..").</dd>
          <br>
      <dt>Databases</dt>
        <dd>A generic tool could perhaps be made to allow any database which uses
          a commercial DBMS to be displayed as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">hypertext</a> view.</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <p>In some cases, writing these servers would mean unscrambling or obtaining
    details of the existing protocols and/or file formats. It may not be practical
    to provide the full functionality of the original system through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">hypertext</a>. In
    general, it will be more important to allow read access to the general public:
    it may be that there is a limited number of people who are providing the
    information, and that they are content to use the existing facilities.</p>
    
    <p>It is sometimes possible to enhance an existing storage system by coding
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">hypertext</a> information in, if one knows that a server will be generating a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">hypertext</a> representation. In 'news' articles, for example, one could use (in
    the text) a standard format for a reference to another article. This would be
    picked out by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">hypertext</a> gateway and used to generate a link to that note.
    This sort of enhancement will allow greater integration between old and new
    systems.</p>
    
    <p>There will always be a large number of information management systems - we
    get a lot of added usefulness from being able to cross-link them. However, we
    will lose out if we try to constrain them, as we will exclude systems and
    hamper the evolution of hypertext in general.</p>
