<p>Many systems are organised hierarchically. The CERNDOC documentation system
is an example, as is the Unix file system, and the VMS/HELP system. A tree has
the practical advantage of giving every node a unique name. However, it does
not allow the system to model the real world. For example, in a hierarchical
HELP system such as VMS/HELP, one often gets to a leaf on a tree such as</p>
<pre>HELP COMPILER SOURCE_FORMAT PRAGMAS DEFAULTS</pre>

<p>only to find a reference to another leaf: "Please see</p>
<pre>HELP COMPILER COMMAND OPTIONS DEFAULTS PRAGMAS"</pre>

<p>and it is necessary to leave the system and re-enter it. What was needed
was a link from one node to another, because in this case the information was
not naturally organised into a tree.</p>

<p>Another example of a tree-structured system is the uucp News system (try
'rn' under Unix). This is a hierarchical system of discussions ("newsgroups")
each containing articles contributed by many people. It is a very useful
method of pooling expertise, but suffers from the inflexibility of a tree.
Typically, a discussion under one newsgroup will develop into a different
topic, at which point it ought to be in a different part of the tree. (See Fig
1).</p>

Doug Thompson has written what I felt was a thoughtful article on
censorship -- my acceptance or rejection of its points is not
particularly germane to this posting, however.

In reply Greg Lee has somewhat tersely objected.

My question (and reason for this posting) is to ask where we might
logically take this subject for more discussion.  Somehow alt.hypertext
does not seem to be the proper place.

Would people feel it appropriate to move to alt.individualism or even
one of the soc groups.  I am not so much concerned with the specific
issue of censorship of rec.humor.funny, but the views presented in
Greg's article.

Speaking only for myself, of course, I am...

<p><i>The Subject field allows notes on the same topic to be linked together
within a "newsgroup". The name of the newsgroup (alt.hypertext) is a
hierarchical name. This particular note is expresses a problem with the strict
tree structure of the scheme: this discussion is related to several areas.
Note that the "References", "From" and "Subject" fields can all be used to
generate links.</i></p>
