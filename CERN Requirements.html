    <p>To be a practical system in the CERN environment, there are a number of
    clear practical requirements.</p>
    
    <h3>Remote access across networks.</h3>
    
    <p>CERN is distributed, and access from remote machines is essential.</p>
    
    <h3>Heterogeneity</h3>
    
    <p>Access is required to the same data from different types of system (VM/CMS,
    Macintosh, VAX/VMS, Unix)</p>
    
    <h3>Non-Centralisation</h3>
    
    <p>Information systems start small and grow. They also start isolated and then
    merge. A new system must allow existing systems to be linked together without
    requiring any central control or coordination.</p>
    
    <h3>Access to existing data</h3>
    
    <p>If we provide access to existing databases as though they were in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">hypertext</a>
    form, the system will get off the ground quicker. This is discussed further
    below.</p>
    
    <h3>Private links</h3>
    
    <p>One must be able to add one's own private links to and from public
    information. One must also be able to annotate links, as well as nodes,
    privately.</p>
    
    <h3>Bells and Whistles</h3>
    
    <p>Storage of ASCII text, and display on 24x80 screens, is in the short term
    sufficient, and essential. Addition of graphics would be an optional extra
    with very much less penetration for the moment.</p>
    
    <h3>Data analysis</h3>
    
    <p>An intriguing possibility, given a large <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">hypertext</a> database with typed
    links, is that it allows some degree of automatic analysis. It is possible to
    search, for example, for anomalies such as undocumented software or divisions
    which contain no people. It is possible to generate lists of people or devices
    for other purposes, such as mailing lists of people to be informed of changes.
    It is also possible to look at the topology of an organisation or a project,
    and draw conclusions about how it should be managed, and how it could evolve.
    This is particularly useful when the database becomes very large, and groups
    of projects, for example, so interwoven as to make it difficult to see the
    wood for the trees.</p>
    
    <p>In a complex place like CERN, it's not always obvious how to divide people
    into groups. Imagine making a large three-dimensional model, with people
    represented by little spheres, and strings between people who have something
    in common at work.</p>
    
    <p>Now imagine picking up the structure and shaking it, until you make some
    sense of the tangle: perhaps, you see tightly knit groups in some places, and
    in some places weak areas of communication spanned by only a few people.
    Perhaps a linked information system will allow us to see the real structure of
    the organisation in which we work.</p>
    
    <h3>Live links</h3>
    
    <p>The data to which a link (or a hot spot) refers may be very static, or it
    may be temporary. In many cases at CERN information about the state of systems
    is changing all the time. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">Hypertext</a> allows documents to be linked into "live"
    data so that every time the link is followed, the information is retrieved. If
    one sacrifices portability, it is possible so make following a link fire up a
    special application, so that diagnostic programs, for example, could be linked
    directly into the maintenance guide.</p>
    
    <h3>Non requirements</h3>
    
    <p>Discussions on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">Hypertext</a> have sometimes tackled the problem of copyright
    enforcement and data security. These are of secondary importance at CERN,
    where information exchange is still more important than secrecy. Authorisation
    and accounting systems for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">hypertext</a> could conceivably be designed which are
    very sophisticated, but they are not proposed here.</p>
    
    <p>In cases where reference must be made to data which is in fact protected,
    existing file protection systems should be sufficient.</p>
    
    <h2>Specific Applications</h2>
    
    <p>The following are three examples of specific places in which the proposed
    system would be immediately useful. There are many others.</p>
    
    <h3>Development Project Documentation.</h3>
    
    <p>The Remote procedure Call project has a skeleton description using Enquire.
    Although limited, it is very useful for recording who did what, where they
    are, what documents exist, etc. Also, one can keep track of users, and can
    easily append any extra little bits of information which come to hand and have
    nowhere else to be put. Cross-links to other projects, and to databases which
    contain information on people and documents would be very useful, and save
    duplication of information.</p>
    
    <h3>Document retrieval.</h3>
    
    <p>The CERNDOC system provides the mechanics of storing and printing
    documents. A linked system would allow one to browse through concepts,
    documents, systems and authors, also allowing references between documents to
    be stored. (Once a document had been found, the existing machinery could be
    invoked to print it or display it).</p>
    
    <h3>The "Personal Skills Inventory".</h3>
    
    <p>Personal skills and experience are just the sort of thing which need
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">hypertext</a> flexibility. People can be linked to projects they have worked on,
    which in turn can be linked to particular machines, programming languages,
    etc.</p>
    
    <h2>The State of the Art in Hypermedia</h2>
    
    <p>An increasing amount of work is being done into hypermedia research at
    universities and commercial research labs, and some commercial systems have
    resulted. There have been two conferences, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">Hypertext</a> '87 and '88, and in
    Washington DC, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NST) hosted
    a workshop on standardisation in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">hypertext</a>, a followup of which will occur
    during 1990.</p>
    
    <p>The Communications of the ACM special issue on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">Hypertext</a> contains many
    references to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">hypertext</a> papers. A bibliography on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">hypertext</a> is given in
    [NIST90], and a uucp newsgroup alt.hypertext exists. I do not, therefore, give
    a list here.</p>
    
    <h3>Browsing techniques</h3>
    
    <p>Much of the academic research is into the human interface side of browsing
    through a complex information space. Problems addressed are those of making
    navigation easy, and avoiding a feeling of being "lost in hyperspace". Whilst
    the results of the research are interesting, many users at CERN will be
    accessing the system using primitive terminals, and so advanced window styles
    are not so important for us now.</p>
    
    <h3>Interconnection or publication?</h3>
    
    <p>Most systems available today use a single database. This is accessed by
    many users by using a distributed file system. There are few products which
    take Ted Nelson's idea of a wide "docuverse" literally by allowing links
    between nodes in different databases. In order to do this, some
    standardisation would be necessary. However, at the standardisation workshop,
    the emphasis was on standardisation of the format for exchangeable media, nor
    for networking. This is prompted by the strong push toward publishing of
    hypermedia information, for example on optical disk. There seems to be a
    general consensus about the abstract data model which a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">hypertext</a> system
    should use.</p>
    
    <p>Many systems have been put together with little or no regard for
    portability, unfortunately. Some others, although published, are proprietary
    software which is not for external release. However, there are several
    interesting projects and more are appearing all the time. Digital's "Compound
    Document Architecture" (CDA) , for example, is a data model which may be
    extendible into a hypermedia model, and there are rumours that this is a way
    Digital would like to go.</p>
    
    <h3>Incentives and CALS</h3>
    
    <p>The US Department of Defence has given a big incentive to hypermedia
    research by, in effect, specifying hypermedia documentation for future
    procurement. This means that all manuals for parts for defence equipment must
    be provided in hypermedia form. The acronym CALS stands for Computer-aided
    Acquisition and Logistic Support).</p>
    
    <p>There is also much support from the publishing industry, and from
    librarians whose job it is to organise information.</p>
    
    <h3>What will the system look like?</h3>
    
    <p>Let us see what components a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">hypertext</a> system at CERN must have. The only
    way in which sufficient flexibility can be incorporated is to separate the
    information storage software from the information display software, with a
    well defined interface between them. Given the requirement for network access,
    it is natural to let this clean interface coincide with the physical division
    between the user and the remote database machine.</p>
    
    <p>This division also is important in order to allow the heterogeneity which
    is required at CERN (and would be a boon for the world in general).</p>

    system.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    <p>Therefore, an important phase in the design of the system is to define this
    interface. After that, the development of various forms of display program and
    of database server can proceed in parallel. This will have been done well if
    many different information sources, past, present and future, can be mapped
    onto the definition, and if many different human interface programs can be
    written over the years to take advantage of new technology and standards.</p>
