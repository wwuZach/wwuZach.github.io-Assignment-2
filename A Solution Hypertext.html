<h3>Personal Experience with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">Hypertext</a></h3>

<style>p{text-align: center;

<p>In 1980, I wrote a program for keeping track of software with which I was
involved in the PS control system. Called Enquire, it allowed one to store
snippets of information, and to link related pieces together in any way. To
find information, one progressed via the links from one sheet to another,
rather like in the old computer game "adventure". I used this for my personal
record of people and modules. It was similar to the application Hypercard
produced more recently by Apple for the Macintosh. A difference was that
Enquire, although lacking the fancy graphics, ran on a multiuser system, and
allowed many people to access the same data.</p>

   Most of the documentation is available on VMS, with the two
   principle manuals being stored in the CERNDOC system.

    1) includes: The VAX/NOTES conference VXCERN::RPC
    2) includes: Test and Example suite
    3) includes: RPC BUG LISTS
    4) includes: RPC System: Implementation Guide
       Information for maintenance, porting, etc.
    5) includes: Suggested Development Strategy for RPC Applications
    6) includes: "Notes on RPC", Draft 1, 20 feb 86
    7) includes: "Notes on Proposed RPC Development" 18 Feb 86
    8) includes: RPC User Manual
       How to build and run a distributed system.

<p>This example is basically a list, so the list of links is more important
than the text on the node itself. Note that each link has a type ("includes"
for example) and may also have comment associated with it. (The bottom line is
a menu bar.)</p>

<p>Soon after my re-arrival at CERN in the DD division, I found that the
environment was similar to that in PS, and I missed Enquire. I therefore
produced a version for the VMS, and have used it to keep track of projects,
people, groups, experiments, software modules and hardware devices with which
I have worked. I have found it personally very useful. I have made no effort
to make it suitable for general consumption, but have found that a few people
have successfully used it to browse through the projects and find out all
sorts of things of their own accord.</p>

<h3>Hot spots</h3>

<p>Meanwhile, several programs have been made exploring these ideas, both
commercially and academically. Most of them use "hot spots" in documents, like
icons, or highlighted phrases, as sensitive areas. touching a hot spot with a
mouse brings up the relevant information, or expands the text on the screen to
include it. Imagine, then, the references in this document, all being
associated with the network address of the thing to which they referred, so
that while reading this document you could skip to them with a click of the
mouse.</p>

<p>"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">Hypertext</a>" is a term coined in the 1950s by Ted Nelson [...], which has
become popular for these systems, although it is used to embrace two different
ideas. One idea (which is relevant to this problem) is the concept:
"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">Hypertext</a>": Human-readable information linked together in an unconstrained
way.</p>

<p>The other idea, which is independent and largely a question of technology
and time, is of multimedia documents which include graphics, speech and video.
I will not discuss this latter aspect further here, although I will use the
word "Hypermedia" to indicate that one is not bound to text.</p>

<p>It has been difficult to assess the effect of a large hypermedia system on
an organisation, often because these systems never had seriously large-scale
use. For this reason, we require large amounts of existing information should
be accessible using any new information management system.</p>
