    <p>Many of the discussions of the future at CERN and the LHC era end with the
    question - Yes, but how will we ever keep track of such a large project?
    This proposal provides an answer to such questions. Firstly, it discusses the
    problem of information access at CERN. Then, it introduces the idea of linked
    information systems, and compares them with less flexible ways of finding
    information.</p>

    <p>It then summarises my short experience with non-linear text systems known
    as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">hypertext</a>, describes what CERN needs from such a system, and what
    industry may provide. Finally, it suggests steps we should take to involve
    ourselves with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">hypertext</a> now, so that individually and collectively we may
    understand what we are creating.</p>
